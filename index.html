					<h4>Hi! I'm Yalon. I love human-centered design, creative problem solving, and all things tech.</h4>
					<p> Right now, I'm enrolled in a double degree program studying Computer Science at Columbia University and Jewish Literature in the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. Besides school, I've spent time at several startups where I helped design products that made sense for users. I hope to continue working in the high tech industry -- envisioning, designing, and developing products that once people see them they won't believe that they had gotten by before without them.</p>
					<p>In my free time, I love spending time outdoors, going on adventures, and reading (currently halfway through Song of Solomon by Toni Morrison). My go-to fun fact is that I've visited North Korea (yup, the picture isn't photoshop).</p>
